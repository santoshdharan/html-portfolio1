<p>Hello Everyone! My name is Sujayeendra. I'm a web developer under learning curve, trying to build web portfolios.</p>

<p>My chosen field of study in highschool, undergrad & postgrad has been commerce. But my interest includes learning,
  leveraging and practicing technological tools. One such avenue over which I laid my hands on is web development. </p>

<p>I'm also a classical singer, numismatist and an avid reader of books ranging from diverse topics. If you're interested,
